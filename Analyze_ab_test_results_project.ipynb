    "CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression summary shows that the coefficients of the terms, except US, are negative, and all their p_values are higher than the significance level of the test. These suggest that conversion is less likely and that the terms are not statistically significant to precisely predict conversion.\n",
    "Also observed is variance in the precision of the coefficients of the terms: The model estimates the US and the US page interaction coefficients with much higher precision than the CA and CA page interaction terms, as reflected by the standard error. This could be attributed to variance in sample size as US sample consist of 203619 users while CA sample has 14499 users. Though the baseline UK, consist of 72466 users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results indicate, with all else constant, that: \n",
    "\n",
    "with decrease unit, a CA user is 0.988285 times likely to convert given new page than a UK user; \n",
    "\n",
    "with unit increase, a US user is 1.005761 times likely to convert given new page than a UK user;\n",
    "\n",
    "with decrease unit, conversion is 0.924703 likely to occur with CA_page interaction than UK_page interaction;\n",
    "\n",
    "with decrease unit, conversion is 0.969090 likely to occur with US_page interaction than UK_page interaction;\n",
    "\n",
    "Though US user show increase in likelihood of conversion than CA, with a p_value of 0.760, its term is statistically insignificant and may not lead to any significant importance in terms of application.\n",
    "For the interaction between country and page, both US_page and CA_page, indicate insignificant interaction that could impact conversion substantially. The direction of likelihood of conversion occurring decreases with unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the p-values of all the terms are well outside of the significance level, suggesting we do not have strong evidence of association between country and conversion, neither exist a substantial interaction between country and page to impact conversion meaningfully. \n",
    "The negative coefficients of the terms and their closeness to zero suggest that conversion is less likely and the effect of conversion, where it occurs, is small. This small effect may not necessarily result in some practical importance.\n",
    "Therfore, we can conclude that given the insignificant association between country and conversion, the insignificant interaction of country and page, and the resultant small effect of the terms, the test does not provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis. So, we fail to reject the null's position that there is no effect of country on conversion when user receive or interract with new page."
